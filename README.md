### Hey 👋

My name is Vishruth, and I'm a student studying CS and Linguistics at the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign. I'm passionate about creating technology to improve people's lives!

🔭 I’m currently working at Hack4Impact, where we build tech for nonprofits with the goal of having positive social impact. I'm also interning for GrammaTech, where I work on static analysis technology.
